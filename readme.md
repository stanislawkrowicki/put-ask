## üéØ Project Goal

Portable and pocket size console, able to load games from external sd card. Possibility of on-line gameplay via Wi-Fi. Custom PCB board, self-made using CNC milling and UV solder mask paint; 3D printed case.

## üîß Hardware Design
The PCB was designed to be produced using a double-sided FR4 PCB blank. Unfortunately, due to the process, every via had to be soldered using copper wire.

### Power Management Unit (IP5306) 
#### read execution paragraph !!!!
The console can be powered remotely using, for example, a 18650 Li-ion battery. Plugging the console into external power through USB-C will power the device and charge the battery. The IP5306 is used according to the typical application from the [datasheet](https://www.datasheetcafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IP5306.pdf). We used a one-LED configuration and skipped the KEY_LED (D5 on the datasheet).

## üíª Usage

Description of how to use the project, e.g., how to start it, available modes, etc.


## üîß Execution
The PCB has been *mostly* successfully produced. We will leave a few notes describing our conclusions about what went wrong and what met or exceeded our expectations.

- Power Management Unit Failure: To be honest, I still don‚Äôt know exactly what went wrong. The design followed the datasheet, but the IC consistently failed, producing enough heat to desolder itself. After several attempts and considering the project deadline, I abandoned the idea of a remote power supply. If I were to do this again, I‚Äôd design a separate board dedicated solely to power management.

- Input-Only Pins (IO35, IO34): These pins lack internal pull-up resistors, and I neglected to include external ones in the design.

- WS2812 Segment Issue: This one‚Äôs due to a simple oversight: the collector of the Q1 transistor isn‚Äôt pulled up to 5V, which prevents proper operation of the LED segment.

- USB-C Port Soldering Difficulty: The mounting pads for the USB-C connector are too small, making the socket difficult to solder reliably. Larger pads would have made assembly easier.
